	If device shows as "unknown" in device manger, might be in bootloader mode (ultra fast flashing status LED), double hit RST button fast to toggle modes back to COMx

*** Remember if you add a Arudino Libary it is pulled from \Document\Arduini\Librarys !!!!

Suspect LG02 locks up if viewing System Logs! Which stops Packet TX to reboot! (no something else is happening when packets received by TNN gateway, but not forward to Application)

"Did you persist the F_Count data either side of the reset? If not, if you dont disable f-count checks, the back end will see the count start again from zero and will assume a replay attack until the device has reached a count where it is larger than the last seen value - try disabling F_Count checks (not recommended long term for deployment - unless using ABP) to see if solves problem - then look at how to improve handling for deployment. Note: A successful OTAA join will reset count at both sides consecutively avoiding this problem, and is inherently more secure that ABP."

"Documentation for future reader:
I changed the Fcnt Reset Frame Counter at:
MyApp → End devices → my-abp-device → General Settings → Network layer → Reset Frame Counters (checked) !!!
Note: do not use in production"
